# Real-Time Stock Market Data Processing with Kafka

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a Kafka producer, Kafka consumer, and provides Kafka commands for gathering and processing real-time stock market data. 

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- `kafka-python` library for Kafka communication
- Access to a running Kafka cluster with your Kafka broker address and topic configured
- Internet access to retrieve real-time stock market data

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies.

### Kafka Producer

To use the Kafka producer, follow these steps:

1. Edit the producer script (`producer.py`) to configure your Kafka broker address.
2. Ensure the `kafka-python` library is installed (you can install it with `pip install kafka-python`).
3. Run the producer script to start gathering and publishing stock market data to your Kafka topic.

### Kafka Consumer

To use the Kafka consumer, follow these steps:

1. Edit the consumer script (`consumer.py`) to configure your Kafka broker address.
2. Ensure the `kafka-python` library is installed (you can install it with `pip install kafka-python`).
3. Run the consumer script to start reading and processing stock market data from your Kafka topic.

## Kafka Commands

A `kafka-commands.txt` file is provided to help you run the Kafka producer and consumer. Update the Kafka broker information and any additional configurations within the scripts as needed.

## Usage

Here's how you can use this project:

1. Start the Kafka producer to gather real-time stock market data and publish it to your Kafka topic.
2. Start the Kafka consumer to process the data. You can customize the consumer script to store data in the desired format or system.
3. Refer to the `kafka-commands.txt` file for sample commands to run the producer and consumer scripts.
